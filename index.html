        <p>What I like about playing piano is that it gives me a choice to playing any genre of music that I want. I can also play sheet music to learn any song without someone having to teach me. I also really like the improvisation side of music since my favorite genre is jazz, and jazz is based on improvisation. In addition, piano and many other instrument have chords which is what the left hand dose on the paino to give a song more sound to it. chords are always satisfying to play at the right time, and hitting them perfectly is a great feeling. The piano is also a nice looking instrument to me, and I think it is the best looking instrument out there. Pianos can also be expensive or cheap since they can come in the traditional acoustic version, or the electric version which is what I have since they are a lot cheaper. Also, acoustic pianos can come in a grand piano form or an upright piano form for homes and apartments to save space. Although, grand pianos typicaly sound better they are more expensive then their upright counterparts. In contrast, electric pianos come in all shapes an sizes, prices and sounds.Electric pianos can make more than just the normal piano sound, it can make any sound you can imagine since you can upload your own set of sounds to an electric piano.

        <p>I started piano in the fall of 2020, and it is now August 2021while I write this. This means, when it becoms fall I would have played piano for a year. These are my thoughts, I have never actually played an instrment before. The only instruments I had payed before where recorders, and some other instruments in school dring music class. So piano was the first instrument I had learned from a music school teacher, and I had stuck with it for the longest time so far since I once tried to teach myself guitar. Although I always wanted to play piano, for instance when I was youger I went to one of my friends houses where he had a piano, and taught me fundimentals. I love piano so far and I really look forward to learning classical songs. Furthermore, piano is an odd instrument since nothing like typeing, or hand cordination, can actually help when you first play piano, but playing other instruments can actually help. Expirence is the only helpfull tool to playing a new instrument, but it not a problem if you don't have it (like I didn't.) In conclusion, everyone learns at different speeds so it is not a problem if you are a slow learner, after all music is in a whole other language! P.S I also love coding, so I have in cluded some of my old apps and games. </p>
